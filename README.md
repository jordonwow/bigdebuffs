A fork of BigDebuffs with some changes/fixes for Dragonflight. At the moment, most of these fixes were contributed by [Bicmex](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bicmex) and were found on his Discord server. All credit for the [original BigDebuffs addon](https://github.com/jordonwow/bigdebuffs) goes to the wonderful [jordonwow on GitHub](https://github.com/jordonwow).

I plan to maintain this fork for as long as the author of the original BigDebuffs remains inactive. However, please keep in mind that I did not write the original code and need to familiarize myself with it before I can fix bugs quickly or write new features.

# BigDebuffs
BigDebuffs is an _extremely lightweight_ addon that hooks the Blizzard raid frames to increase the debuff size of crowd control effects. Additionally, it replaces unit frame portraits with debuff durations when important debuffs are present.
